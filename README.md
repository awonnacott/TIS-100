# TIS-100
My TIS-100 saves and levels
TIS-100 is a game by Zachtronics. They are fantastic. They made SpaceChem, which is like coding. They made Infiniminer, a partial inspiration of Minecraft.

I decided that TIS-100 saves count as programs.
Like any good programmer, I use revision control.
I am playing a game. I do not use comments.

Beware spoilers!
